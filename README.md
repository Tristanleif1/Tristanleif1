### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tristan!
  
Transitioning from a solid foundation in Biology and invaluable experience as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) to the dynamic realm of software engineering, I embody a unique convergence of adaptability, analytical rigor, and technological innovation. My journey, marked by a profound commitment to helping others and a natural curiosity in biology and the mechanics of technology, has equipped me with a distinctive perspective in problem-solving and creating impactful digital solutions. At App Academy, I delved deep into a comprehensive tech stack, learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React which allowed me to get in touch with my creative side by designing aesthetic, user-friendly interfaces coupled with embracing the complexities of backend engineering where I became proficient in SQL, SQLAlchemy, PosgreSQL, Python and Flask and data structures with a particular zeal, driven by an innate desire to understand and optimize the underlying systems that power our digital world. My approach to software engineering is deeply influenced by my diverse experiences, blending a patient-centric mindset from healthcare with methodical, evidence-based problem-solving strategies honed through scientific training. I am motivated by a relentless pursuit of innovation, ready to tackle challenging problems and contribute to projects that not only push technological boundaries but also have a lasting societal impact.

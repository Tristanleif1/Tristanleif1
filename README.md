### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tristan!
  
With a background in Biology and hands-on experience as an EMT, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking, adaptability, and a commitment to creating impactful digital solutions. My journey into software engineering was fueled by a desire to use technology to solve real-world problems. Through App Academyâ€™s full-stack program, I developed a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, SQL, and PostgreSQL, which enabled me to explore both the creative aspects of front-end design and the logic-driven complexities of backend engineering. Iâ€™ve created several full-stack applications that reflect my interests and skillset. Rescue Ready is a study tool for EMT students preparing for the NREMT exam, built with React, Redux, Flask, and PostgreSQL, where users can create, manage, and review flashcards and quizzes. My group project, Pledge Palooza (a Kickstarter-inspired platform), allows users to create and back projects, integrating AWS for media uploads and employing Redux for state management. I also developed Tristanâ€™s Travels, an AirBnB clone, that lets users create and manage listings and write reviews, implementing SQL data handling and a responsive, user-friendly interface.During my internship with Skysense, I worked at the intersection of AI and agriculture, developing and deploying AI models, enhancing Skysenseâ€™s website and analytics tools, and handling high-value crop data with precision. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and teamwork in a fast-paced, high-impact environment. Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my technical repertoire with PyTorch, SCSS, Pug, and Vue.js. With a scientific mindset from my biology background and a user-focused approach from my healthcare experience, Iâ€™m eager to bring my skills to projects that make a meaningful difference and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with technology.
